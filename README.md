# BTD-Mod-Loader
This is a mod loader for BTD5 and BTDB. It supports jet modding and nkhook plugins

The program will save all of the mods that you use with it, so you can easily switch back and forth between mods and clean installs.

The program also has built in NKHook support for BTD5. Once NKHook is ported to BTDB, it will support that as well.

To use it, download and run the program, browse for the location that BTD5 or BTDB is installed in (You're looking for the directory with the .exe). Then add all the mods you want to your "Mods" Folder.


Important Note: To allow for more advanced mods, this program doesn't store them as you would expect. Please look at the "ExampleMod.zip" in your mods folder.
